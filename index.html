		<h2>History</h2>
		<fieldset>
			<p>&quot;K Lovely Flower English School&quot; was founded by the couple Mr. K Ranjan Sharma and Mrs. K Kumari Sinha in 2004. To open their own school and provide the best curriculam & teaching environment were their dreams. At the time of starting, There were only few students because of their new brand and new curriculam. But as the time were going on, They were trying their best to provide a environment that would completely suit the students. And finally in 2007,They arrived at that position, where they wanted to be. And This was the great success for them. In 2008, They named their school as an abbreviation &quot;K.L.F.E.S.&quot; and established its importance.
